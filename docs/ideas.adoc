=== Open questions

* automatic sidecar injection not working on DeploymentConfig, manual `istioctl kube-inject` works with `oc apply`


=== Ideas

==== Options for routing

* Possible to piggyback on Tracing variables to avoid additional http header propagation?
* Subdomain as entrypoint vs http header?
** Subdomain easy for user access
** http header: js lib for client to detect available versions and swap between them?

==== PR preview deployment

===== Report stats on PR

* error rate up 10%
* performance down 10%

===== Control type of deployment via PR commands

* "measure 10% shadow"
* "measure correctness"
* "expose"

==== Local Dev 

`cli-x proxy -n myapp servicex -strategy 'userauth:me'`
    
* Modify VirtualService
* Clone existing service
* Set strategy
* Route to new service
* teleprecense new service
* start local

==== Reverse lookup service to source

`cli-x start-work -n myapp servicex`
    
* lookup servicex in myapp namespace
* lookup git-ref on service
* clone/checkout git-ref

==== Create special egress gateway for the dev route to external call inspection/debug

* feedback traffic to client, e.g. "external calls" window in IDE

=== Concepts

==== X

When a service is in 'observation'/dev mode

==== X Trace

The method of determining when a call is in a X 'session' and allow services/middlware to act accordingly

==== Shadow Proxy

Injected/Configured during X to control behavior of responses of calls to external/other services
